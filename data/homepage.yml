  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am passionate for all things technology, particularly intrigued by the infinite potential
    of code and automation.
    When not behind my computer,
    you&#39;ll find me playing squash, climbing rocks, or cycling on a bike.
    I like to move and try new things!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Professionally, my areas of focus include design, automation and way-of-working.
    I have a sharp eye for improvement opportunities and original ways to create value.
    I enjoy designing and coding as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.
    </p>'
